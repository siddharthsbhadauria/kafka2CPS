## Blob Triggered Azure Function Documentation

### Overview

This documentation outlines the setup and functionality of a Blob Triggered Azure Function designed to process JSON files in conjunction with metadata files. The function extracts relevant information from the metadata file and copies specified files to a new storage account. Additionally, a record of these actions is audited into a PostgreSQL database.

### Function Components

1. **Blob Trigger:**
   - The function is triggered by the creation of a JSON file in the specified blob storage container.

2. **Metadata Check:**
   - Upon trigger, the function retrieves the metadata file with a similar name to the triggered JSON file.

3. **File Extraction and Copy:**
   - Extracts filenames and metadata from the metadata file.
   - Copies files listed in metadata to a new storage account.

4. **Auditing:**
   - Records information about the copied files, including filename, metadata, and any relevant statistics (count or size), into a PostgreSQL database.

### Configuration

#### Azure Resources

1. **Blob Storage:**
   - Ensure the blob storage account contains two containers: one for JSON files and another for metadata files.

2. **Storage Account (Destination):**
   - Set up a new storage account to copy files.

3. **PostgreSQL Database:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database to store audit records.

#### Azure Function Settings

1. **Blob Trigger Binding:**
   - Configure the trigger to listen for JSON file creations in the designated blob container.

2. **Storage Account Connections:**
   - Set up connections to both the source and destination storage accounts.

3. **PostgreSQL Connection:**
   - Configure connection strings for the PostgreSQL database.

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your Azure Function App settings:

- `SOURCE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: Connection string for the source blob storage account.
- `DESTINATION_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: Connection string for the destination storage account.
- `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.

### Code Structure

The function code should include logic for:
- Extracting metadata from the corresponding file.
- Copying files to the destination storage account.
- Recording audit information into the PostgreSQL database.

### Deployment

Deploy the Azure Function and associated resources to your Azure subscription.

### Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Monitor Azure Function logs for any errors or unexpected behavior.
- Ensure that the required permissions are set for the storage accounts and PostgreSQL database.
- Check network configurations to ensure proper communication between resources.

### Conclusion

This Blob Triggered Azure Function provides an automated solution for processing JSON files, copying specified files, and maintaining an audit trail in a PostgreSQL database. Adjustments to metadata formats or additional functionalities can be made based on specific use cases.
